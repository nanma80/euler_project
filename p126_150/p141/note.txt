d, q, r in a geometric sequence

r < d always. r != 0
either q, r, d
or r, q, d
or r, d, q

Three possibilities
qd = r^2
rd = q^2
rq = d^2

n = q * d + r
We can enumerate geometric sequences and compute n

Geometric sequence
a, b, c
n = a * c + b = b^2 + b = b * (b + 1). 
This value can't be a square
or
n = b * c + a = bc + b^2/c = b(c + b/c)
=sqrt(ac)*c + a

c > a
n > a^2 + a

b = ar
c = ar^2

n = a^2 r^3 + a
