Let p(q) denote the period of the fraction q; then sequence is generated by p(i / (10k-1)), k=2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9; k <= i <= 9 and the concatenations of those periods, e.g., p(7/39)=a(5) p(2/19)=a(17).


Example if k=5: p((5+2)/49)=142857 which is in the sequence as the concatenations 142857142857, 142857142857142857, 142857142857142857142857, etc. - Benoit Cloitre, Feb 02 2002

The i in p(i / (10k-1)) is the last digit of the period, while k is equal to the ratio (right-rotated of p)/p. Thus no concatenation of any different such p's can be in the sequence. There are 8*9/2 = 36 terms which are not concatenation of previous terms, the last one being a(124) = 1525423728813559322033898305084745762711864406779661016949 with 58 digits. The term a(3)=p(7/49) is the only period of length (6) different from the length (42) of the other terms corresponding to the same value of k. - M. F. Hasler, Nov 18 2007
