If a + bi divides n, then

gamma = gcd(a, b)
a = alpha gamma
b = beta gamma
alpha and beta are coprime

n/(a + bi) = (na - nbi)/(a^2 + b^2) 
= (alpha n - beta n i)/((alpha^2 + beta^2)*gamma)

Suppose n can't divide denominator = ((alpha^2 + beta^2)*gamma)
and n/denominator reduces to n'/d' where d' > 1. Then d' must divide both alpha and beta, which contradicts to the assumption that alpha and beta are coprime.

Therefore n = k * ((alpha^2 + beta^2)*gamma)

For any alpha, find beta <= alpha such that alpha and beta are coprime.
For any gamma >= 1 and k >= 1,
(alpha gamma  + or - i * beta gamma ) is a factor of n = k * ((alpha^2 + beta^2)*gamma)
(beta gamma   + or - i * alpha gamma) is a factor of n = k * ((alpha^2 + beta^2)*gamma)
